Grive aims at making life simpler when switching from Windows to Linux

This was developed with the aim to create a free and open source GDrive client to make things simpler and users won't
need to switch to other cloud file storing platforms or have to pay for commercial clients doing the same.

The parameters that can be used are:

* -reset

Reset account associated with Grive and give it the read and write permissions to your Google Drive. Automatically executed at the
first run of Grive.

* -start

Start the automatic GDrive syncing of the folders set as upload directories.

* -stop

Stop the automatic GDrive syncing of the folders set as upload directories.

* -status

Shows whether GDrive is uploading automatically or not.

* -version

Shows the current version of the Grive.

* -config

Gives option to edit the configuration file on which automatic upload and download works.
- Up_Directory: The directory where the files that are to be uploaded are given, relative to home directory.
    (e.g. for "~/Documents/to_GDrive", input "Documents/to_GDrive")
    (Default is "to_GDrive" directory in your Documents folder)
- Down_Directory: The directory where the files are downloaded, relative to home directory.
    (e.g. for "~/Documents/from_GDrive", input "Documents/from_GDrive")
    (Default is "from_GDrive" directory in you Documents folder)
- Remove_Post_Upload: [Y/N] 'Y' removes the local file post upload. 'N' moves the file to GDrive download folder
post upload.
    (Default is 'N')
- Share_Link: [Y/N] 'Y' puts the shareable link of the file uploaded in share.txt in Up_Directory.
    (Default is 'Y')
- Write_Permission: [Y/N] 'Y' gives the write permission in the sharable link.

Configuration is stored in config.json as a dictionary which can be manually edited as well.
